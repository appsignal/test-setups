# Test setups

<!-- Generated from support/templates/README.md.erb -->

Run test setups using Docker, requirements to run this:

* A recent Docker version that includes Compose.
* Any 2.0+ version of Ruby

Next, checkout the integrations locally:

```
rake integrations:clone
```

Generate an environment file using a valid push api key you
can get on [AppSignal](https://appsignal.com):

```
rake global:set_push_api_key key=<key>
```

To start a test setup:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app=<%= app %> app:up
<% end %>```

This will boot a test environment with AppSignal enabled listening on
[localhost](http://localhost:4001). The agent log and lock files are
accessible in the `working_directory`.

To restart the app container after making changes to an integration:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app=<%= app %> app:restart
<% end %>```

To run bash:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app=<%= app %> app:bash
<% end %>```

To run the console (if implemented in the test app):

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app=<%= app %> app:console
<% end %>```

To send in a diagnose (if implemented in the test app);

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app=<%= app %> app:diagnose
<% end %>```

Tail the appsignal log:

```
<% @apps.each do |app | %>rake app=<%= app %> app:tail:appsignal
<% end %>```

Open the browser pointing to the app:

```
rake app:open
```

Reset the integrations to their current `main`:

```
rake integrations:reset
```

## Generate a new test setup

To generate a new test setup run:

```
rake app=lang/app app:new
```

Then customize the generated files and place your code in `app` within
the generated skeleton app. Make sure to map the port to localhost to
`4001`. If you want to run tasks such as generators do that from within
the Docker setup by using the `app:bash` task.
